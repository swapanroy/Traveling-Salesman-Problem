While not a guaranteed solution for finding the absolute shortest path, it can be a valuable heuristic to guide the search process and improve the efficiency of the TSP algorithm.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Warning control\nimport warnings\nwarnings.filterwarnings('ignore')","metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-01-28T19:24:57.125502Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-01-28T19:24:57.125762Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-01-28T19:24:57.130685Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-01-28T19:24:57.125730Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-01-28T19:24:57.129631Z"}},"outputs":[],"execution_count":null},{"cell_type":"code","source":"import numpy as np\nimport itertools\nfrom scipy.stats import entropy\nimport time\n\n\"\"\"\n  Function to get the shortest route for the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) \n  using a heuristic based on Kullback-Leibler divergence.\n\n\"\"\"\n\n\ndef tsp_kl_divergence(distances):\n\n  num_cities = len(distances)\n  best_route = None\n  min_distance = float('inf')\n  min_kl_divergence = float('inf')\n\n  start_time = time.time()\n\n  # Generate all possible permutations of city indices\n  all_routes = list(itertools.permutations(range(num_cities)))\n\n  for route in all_routes:\n    # Calculate the route distance\n    total_distance = 0\n    for i in range(num_cities - 1):\n      total_distance += distances[route[i]][route[i+1]]\n    total_distance += distances[route[-1]][route[0]]  # Return to the starting city\n\n    # Print the distance of each route\n    print(f\"Route: {route} - Distance: {total_distance}\")\n\n    # Create probability distributions \n    route_probs = np.zeros(num_cities)\n    uniform_probs = np.ones(num_cities) / num_cities\n    for i in range(num_cities):\n      route_probs[route[i]] = 1 / num_cities \n\n    # Calculate KL divergence \n    kl_divergence_value = entropy(route_probs, uniform_probs) \n\n    # Select the route with the lowest KL divergence \n    if total_distance < min_distance or (total_distance == min_distance and kl_divergence_value < min_kl_divergence):\n      min_distance = total_distance\n      best_route = route\n      min_kl_divergence = kl_divergence_value\n\n  end_time = time.time()\n  elapsed_time = end_time - start_time\n\n  return best_route, min_distance, elapsed_time\n\n","metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-01-28T20:19:03.899176Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-01-28T20:19:03.899677Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-01-28T20:19:03.909537Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-01-28T20:19:03.899640Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-01-28T20:19:03.908182Z"}},"outputs":[],"execution_count":null},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Running between with 4 cities:\nnum_cities = 4\ndistances = np.random.randint(1, 50, size=(num_cities, num_cities))  # Sample distance matrix\nnp.fill_diagonal(distances, 0)  # Distance from city to itself is 0\n\nbest_route, min_distance, elapsed_time = tsp_kl_divergence(distances)\n\nprint(\"Best Route:\", best_route)\nprint(\"Minimum Distance:\", min_distance)\nprint(f\"Elapsed Time: {elapsed_time:.3f} seconds\")","metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-01-28T20:09:04.334468Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-01-28T20:09:04.334827Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-01-28T20:09:04.364522Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-01-28T20:09:04.334798Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-01-28T20:09:04.363768Z"}},"outputs":[],"execution_count":null},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Running between with 8 cities:\nnum_cities = 8\ndistances = np.random.randint(1, 50, size=(num_cities, num_cities))  # Sample distance matrix\nnp.fill_diagonal(distances, 0)  # Distance from city to itself is 0\n\nbest_route, min_distance, elapsed_time = tsp_kl_divergence(distances)\n\nprint(\"Best Route:\", best_route)\nprint(\"Minimum Distance:\", min_distance)\nprint(f\"Elapsed Time: {elapsed_time:.3f} seconds\")","metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-01-28T20:09:40.850361Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-01-28T20:09:40.850753Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-01-28T20:10:17.524492Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-01-28T20:09:40.850724Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-01-28T20:10:17.523600Z"}},"outputs":[],"execution_count":null},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# In Conclusion:\n\n* **The Big O notation for the provided TSP implementation using the KL divergence heuristic is O(n!), where 'n' is the number of cities.**\n\n* **Here's why:** \n    - Brute-Force Approach: The core of the algorithm involves iterating through all possible permutations of city order.\n    - Number of Permutations: The number of permutations of 'n' cities is given by n!
